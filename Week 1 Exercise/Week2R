### Week 2: 'Counting number of characters'

## Goal: Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the 
# input string and the number of characters the string contains. 
# Ex/ "What is the input string? Lindsay" "Lindsay has 7 characters."
# Be sure the output contains the original string.
# Use a single output statement to construct the output.
# Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.

numString<-function(){
  string<-readline(prompt = "What is your name? ")
  string<-as.character(string) # in case the answer to 'readline' ends up being a number, like '100'
  num<-nchar(string)
  print(paste0("What is the input string? " , string,"; '",string, "' has ",num, " characters."))} 
numString()

## Challenge 1: If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter something into the program.

numString<-function(){
  string<-readline(prompt = "What is your name? ")
  string<-as.character(string) # in case the answer to 'readline' ends up being a number, like '100'
  if(string == ""){string<- readline(prompt = "You must enter something into the program. Your name: ")}
  num<-nchar(string)
  print(paste0("What is the input string? " , string,"; '",string, "' has ",num, " characters."))} 
numString()

## Challenge 2: Implement this program using a GUI and update the character counter every time a key
# is pressed. If your language doesn't have a particularly friendly GUI library, try doing this 
# exercise with HTML and JavaScript instead.

# I don't think R can use GUIs easily. I'm not going to try this challenge.
